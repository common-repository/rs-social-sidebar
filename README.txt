Another social plugin :). Difference is the hover effect.

== Description ==

Another social plugin :). Difference is the hover effect. It can be in the left or right side. Social plugin will be shown on hovering over any of the icons.

Now it supports all major social networks i.e., facebook, google plus and twitter.

After getting huge success in [Opencart](http://www.opencart.com/index.php?route=extension/extension/info&extension_id=19473&filter_username=rosinghal), I have made this free plugin for Wordpress.
